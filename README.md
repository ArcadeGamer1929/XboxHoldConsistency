# Xbox Hold Consistency

A mod for Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ that fixes an inconsistency with hold sprites when using the Xbox layout.

It falls back onto using the lighter X sprite from the PlayStation layout, despite using the Switch's darker X sprite everywhere else, which matches the style of the Xbox layout. This mod fixes that.
